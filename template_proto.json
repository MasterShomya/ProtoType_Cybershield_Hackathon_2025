May be critical, but falls under legitimate dissent or reporting.\n    * **21-50:** Borderline. Uses hostile language but may not directly call for violence or disintegration.\n    * **51-80:** Clearly anti-India. Actively promotes hatred or questions India's integrity.\n    * **81-100:** Severely anti-India. Direct and unambiguous calls for violence, separatism, or the destruction of the nation.\n\n4.  **Contextual Information:** Provide a brief, neutral, and concise explanation (2-3 sentences) for a layman. It should explain the real-world event, incident, or ongoing issue the statement is likely referring to.\n\n**# Required Output Format**\n\nProvide your response ONLY in the following format.
